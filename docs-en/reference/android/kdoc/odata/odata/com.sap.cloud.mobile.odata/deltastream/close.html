<p>Close this stream and release all associated resources, checking first that the end of stream has been reached. Can safely be called even if the stream was previously closed. If a delta link was encountered before the stream was closed, it will be available via the <code><a href="getdeltalink.html">DeltaStream.deltaLink</a></code> property only after the stream is closed. If a next link was encountered before the stream was closed, it will be available via the <code><a href="getnextlink.html">DeltaStream.nextLink</a></code> property only after the stream is closed.</p>
