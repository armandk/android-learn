<p>This class serves as the entry point to a set of framework APIs that allow you to extend and implement your own usage reporting based on your own server, to collect, store, and upload client usage events in a flexible way. <pre><code>
1. Initialization Usage-- Need to implement <a href="../usagestore/index.html">UsageStore</a> before you can instantiate the
   Usage:
// Instantiates your UsageStore implementation, for example:
    MyUsageStore store = new MyUsageStore("myStoreDatabaseName");
    Usage usage = new Usage(store);


2. <a href="../usagerecord/index.html">UsageRecord</a>-- Represents a single unit of usage information reported by a
   UsageReporter, which contains:
   a. <strong>Date</strong>-- The date when the UsageRecord is reported and persisted.
   b. <strong><a href="../usageinfo/index.html">UsageInfo</a> Object</strong>-- Contains server specific event details as name-value pairs
      saved in a HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;.
   c. <strong>User-defined event type</strong> implemented as an Enum instance.

   <strong>Extending UsageRecord</strong>:
public class MyUsageRecord extends UsageRecord&lt;MyUsageRecord.MyEvent&gt; {
            // Constructor-- Constructs a usage record with one of my event type and a date.
            MyUsageRecord(MyEvent event, Date date, UsageInfo info) {
                super(event, date, info);
                logger.debug("Instantiated Usage Record: Event[{}], Date: {}", event, date);
            }
        }

        // User-defined event types.
        enum MyEvent {
            EVENT1, EVENT2, EVENT3, EVENT4, EVENT5
        }


3. <a href="../usagereporter/index.html">UsageReporter</a>
   A <strong>target</strong> is a logical group of collected events and information, collected for a specific
   purpose, and sent to a given analytics server.
   All events are reported using a reporter assigned with a target ID. The reporterâ€™s only task is
   to generate UsageRecord which is stored in an implementation of
   UsageStore.

   <strong>Reporting Usage Events</strong>:
// 1. Instantiates a reporter by specifying the target ID and the store.
        UsageReporter reporter = new UsageReporter(myTargetID, usage.getStore());

        // 2. Registers and enables the reporter.
        usage.registerReporter(reporter);

        // 3. Creates a usage record with user-defined event type.

        //    a. Initiates a UsageInfo with a HashMap, then fills it with implementation
        //       specific name-value pairs.
        UsageInfo info = new UsageInfo(new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;());
        info.setValue("Screen", "Property Screen")
            .setValue("DeviceId", "1235")
            .setValue("InfoCategory", "UI");

        //    b. Instantiates a usage record with an event type, date, and UsageInfo object.
        MyUsageRecord record = new MyUsageRecord(MyUsageRecord.MyEvent.EVENT1, new Date(), info);

        // 4. Reports usage, the record will be persisted in the usage store.
        reporter.reports(record);


4. <a href="../usagesnapshot/index.html">UsageSnapshot</a>
   A snapshot object is created via UsageStore.getSnapshot(androidContext, targetID)
   and is used by the Usage Uploader when uploading usage data to the remote server.

   It contains a collection of UsageRecords reported by a UsageReporter,
   grouped under a Target ID, and persisted in a UsageStore.

   The records collected in a snapshot is using the creation date of the snapshot as the cut-off
   date, that is, all UsageRecords reported before the cut-off date will be included in the
   snapshot.

5. <a href="../usagestore/index.html">UsageStore</a>--
   a. An interface that manages the storing, retrieval, and deletion of UsageRecords.
   b. Used by the Usage Uploader to take a snapshot of records associated with a target ID.

   <strong>Generating a Snapshot</strong>:
// This is usually done when uploading usage records.
        UsageSnapshot snapshot = usage.getStore().getSnapshot(androidContext, myTargetID);


6. Usage Uploader-- Based on your server's protocol and data format, the implementation should
   follow the steps below:
   a. Takes a Usage Snapshot.
   b. Transforms each Usage Record in the snapshot to the data format required by the server.
   c. Uploads the data to a given server.
   d. Removes Usage Records in the snapshot from the Usage Store upon success upload.

   For example,
// In the uploader's upload implementation:

        // Uses try-with statement, which will invoke snapshot.close() at the end.
        try (
            // 1. Takes a snapshot from the instance of your UsageStore implementation.
            MyUsageSnapshotImpl snapshot = usage.getStore().getSnapshot(androidContext, myTargetID);
        ) {
            // 2. Iterates through the usage records in the snapshot.
            while (snapshot.hasNext()) {
                MyUsageRecord record = snapshot.next();
                ...
                // 3. Converts the record to the format required by your server.
                ...
            }

            // 4. Uploads to the server.
            ...
            // 5. If the upload is successful, removes the records in the snapshot.
            snapshot.removeRecords();
        } catch (SomeException ex) {
            // Error handling.
            ...
        }
